This is a mobile friendly portfolio site built for a design studio named Kix Creative Studio. The owner of the studio is a UI designer. She designed the website and I collaborate with her to build the final site.

The website is target to be adaptive to all Apple devices including phones, tablets laptops and desktops. I use SVG for every icon in the site to reduce the page weight and apply scroll effect to make it more interesting. At the contact section, thereâ€™s a PHP contact form that enables visitors to send message directly on the page.
